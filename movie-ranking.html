<p>It was amazing experience for me. My usual routine is to watch movie without seeing it's trailer or any of the clippings. I was awestruck by the movie characters and emotion that is conveyed. I was in full tears when I saw the climax of the movie. The director has conveyed the emotion pretty well. No scene was forced to the movie. It was smooth and fit</p>
<h3>Premalu</h3>
